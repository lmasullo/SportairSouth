  <p>
    Users entering materials into ED Shifts are responsible for the content of
    that material. This includes, but is not exclusive of all copyrighted
    information. ED Shifts's servers are not certified HIPPA compliant and the
    user should not upload and patient identifiable information. ED Shifts has

  <h1>Hosting</h1>

  <p>
    ED Shifts has contracted with our commercial web presence provider
    <a href="https://netlify.com" class="a" target="_blank">Netlify</a>, and
    database provider
    <a href="https://8base.com" class="a" target="_blank">8Base</a>, for a
    comprehensive data preservation and storage solution consisting of a full
    weekly backup with daily incremental backup through a centralized high-speed
    storage system. The support backup of the live 8Base Server can occur
    without shutting down the database. In most instances of server failure, a
    complete database restoration up to the moment of failure the day before can
    be performed. The User agrees to hold ED Shifts harmless in the event that
    Google Firebase does not provide a copy of the backup database or
    satisfactory customer services for an adequate database restoration.
  </p>

    interaction with Stripe is transmitted using SSL. ED Shifts does not store
    any user credit card information. Only the plan purchased and purchase date
    is stored by ED Shifts.

    you were mistakenly charged with. However, ED Shifts will not be liable for
    mistakes, errors, malfunctions and miscalculations made by the payment
    service providers.

  <h1>Confidentiality</h1>

  <p>
    “Confidential Information” means any information furnished or made available
    by one party to the other, that is identified as “confidential” or
    “proprietary,” either by legend on written or electronically stored
    material, or which ought reasonably to be recognized as confidential or
    proprietary by virtue of its nature or the circumstances of its disclosure.
    The foregoing will not be considered as Confidential Information of a party:
    (a) information already known to the other party without an obligation of
    confidentiality, (b) information that is or becomes publicly known other

    subject to the other party's prior permission. Each of you and ED Shifts
    will take precautions to maintain the confidentiality of the other party's
    Confidential Information with the same degree of care as to its own
    Confidential Information, but in no case less than reasonable care. Upon
    termination of these Terms, either party will use commercially reasonable
    efforts to delete all copies of the other's Confidential Information that is
    stored on its system or in its possession, except for retaining data for
    legitimate business purposes or as required under applicable laws, including
    under tax related requirements, account settling, record keeping, archiving
    and legal issues.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a party is compelled by law to disclose the other party’s confidential
    information, then such party will provide the other party a prior notice of
    such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable
    assistance, at the other party's cost, if the other party wishes to contest
    the disclosure.
